1. Digits

If we have a number and apply modulo 10 we get the last digit of the number
    7789 % 10 = 9
    since in the quotient we will have the nearest lower number (i.e 7780)

Now we have 778 % 10 = 8
77 % 10 = 7
7 % 10 = 7
Now in the end if we further find modulo we get 0
(Basically we are performing division and returning the integer part for further modulo operation and returning the last digit since it is the remainder)

2. Reversing a number:

Similar logic to counting digits
Here we find modulo 10 and store last digit 
then we apply a formula (rev_num*10) + last_digit
and n = n/10 to return the interger part of thr number after modulo
