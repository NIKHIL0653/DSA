# python is dynamically typed
    # hence no need to specify data type
# python is case sensitive
# python has built in support for lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.

#Note:
n = 0
n = n + 1 # allowed
n += 1 # allowed
n++ # not allowed

# In python NULL is None

n = 4
n = None

# In python we dont need parentheses in conditionals
# but required in case of multi line conditional

n, m = 1,2
if((n>2 and
    n != m)or n == 1):
