When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.
If not termination condition is specified the function shall keep
calling itself till it runs out of memory.This phenomenon is called stack overflow

The condition where the function stops calling itself is called as the base condition

What is a recursion tree?
A recursion tree is a tree data structure that is used to visualize the recursive calls of a function.
It is a tree where each node represents a function call and the edges represent the recursive calls.
The root of the tree is the initial function call and the leaf nodes are the base cases.

** Visualy representing the way and order the functions called themselves
is called a recursion tree. **
